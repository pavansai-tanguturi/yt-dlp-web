# üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Anti-Detection Features

Your YouTube downloader now includes state-of-the-art anti-detection capabilities to help bypass YouTube's bot detection systems.

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. **Multi-Layered Stealth System**
- **Primary Stealth**: Advanced browser fingerprinting with realistic headers
- **Residential Simulation**: Mimics real ISP connections from major providers
- **Mobile Client Simulation**: Uses YouTube Music and mobile APIs
- **Ultra-Stealth Mode**: Complete identity reconstruction for aggressive detection
- **Minimal Fallback**: Last-resort extraction with minimal fingerprint

### 2. **Intelligent Session Management**
- Tracks success rates of different browser profiles
- Automatically selects the best-performing profiles
- Rotates IP addresses from realistic ISP ranges
- Maintains session history to avoid patterns

### 3. **Realistic Behavior Simulation**
- **Human-like Timing**: Varies delays based on time of day and user patterns
- **Browser Entropy**: Generates realistic screen resolutions, memory, CPU specs
- **ISP Fingerprinting**: Uses actual IP ranges from Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.
- **Referrer Variation**: Simulates arriving from Google, Reddit, direct links

### 4. **Progressive Fallback Strategy**
When detection occurs, the system automatically tries:
1. **Residential Identities**: Different ISPs and locations
2. **Mobile APIs**: YouTube Music, Android app clients
3. **Ultra-Stealth**: Complete identity reconstruction
4. **Minimal Mode**: Lowest-footprint extraction

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `anti_detection_config.py` to customize behavior:

```python
# Adjust delays for your environment
CLOUD_MIN_DELAY = 5.0  # Increase for more stealth
CLOUD_MAX_DELAY = 12.0

# Quality fallback strategy
PRIMARY_MAX_QUALITY = "1080"    # Start with high quality
EMERGENCY_MAX_QUALITY = "480"   # Fall back to lower quality
```

## üîç How It Works

### Browser Fingerprint Resistance
- **User Agent Rotation**: 8+ realistic browser profiles
- **Header Consistency**: Matching sec-ch-ua headers for each browser
- **Viewport Simulation**: Realistic screen resolutions and device specs
- **Language/Timezone**: Varies based on simulated location

### IP Address Management
- **ISP Simulation**: Uses real IP ranges from major providers
- **Geographic Consistency**: Matches timezone/language to IP location
- **Rotation Pool**: 100+ pre-generated realistic IP addresses
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents IP reuse within 1 hour

### Timing and Behavioral Patterns
- **Human Simulation**: Faster during work hours, slower at night
- **Jitter Addition**: Random variations to avoid robotic patterns
- **Progressive Delays**: Longer delays after failures
- **Session Spacing**: Realistic gaps between requests

## üö® When Bot Detection Is Triggered

The system automatically detects these error patterns:
- `403 Forbidden`, `429 Too Many Requests`
- Messages containing: "bot", "captcha", "verify", "suspicious"
- Rate limiting or sign-in requirements

**Response Strategy:**
1. **Immediate**: Switch to different ISP identity with longer delay
2. **Persistent**: Try mobile clients (YouTube Music, Android app)
3. **Aggressive**: Ultra-stealth mode with complete identity reset
4. **Last Resort**: Minimal extraction with lowest possible footprint

## üìä Success Rate Tracking

The system learns which profiles work best:
- Tracks success/failure rates for each browser profile
- Prefers profiles with higher success rates
- Switches to different approaches after consecutive failures
- Logs successful configurations for future use

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If downloads keep failing:
1. **Increase delays**: Edit config to use longer delays
2. **Check error messages**: Look for specific detection patterns
3. **Try different times**: YouTube detection varies by time/load
4. **Use VPN**: Combine with VPN for additional IP diversity

### Performance vs Stealth Trade-offs:
- **Maximum Stealth**: High delays, multiple fallbacks, lower quality
- **Balanced**: Moderate delays, smart profile selection
- **Speed Priority**: Lower delays, higher risk of detection

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom ISP Profiles
Add your own ISP ranges in `stealth_utils.py`:
```python
('YourISP', ['123.45', '67.89', '101.112'])
```

### Profile Success Monitoring
Check which profiles work best in your environment:
```python
print(session_tracker.profile_success_rate)
```

### Emergency Mode
For maximum stealth when under heavy detection:
- Enable emergency mode delays (20-45 seconds)
- Use minimal quality settings
- Single retry attempts only

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Don't abuse**: Use reasonable delays between downloads
2. **Vary timing**: Don't download at exact intervals
3. **Monitor logs**: Watch for detection patterns
4. **Update regularly**: Keep yt-dlp updated for latest fixes
5. **Respect limits**: YouTube's resources aren't unlimited

The system is designed to be respectful while being effective. It simulates realistic user behavior rather than trying to overwhelm YouTube's systems.
